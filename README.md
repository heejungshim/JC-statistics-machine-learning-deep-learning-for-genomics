We discuss papers covering topics related to statistics and machine learning (with an emphasis on deep learning) for genomics applications. Feel free to email me at <heejung.shim@unimelb.edu.au> if you'd like to join for discussion or you have any paper suggestions

* We meet fortnightly on Monday at noon in MIG ground floor meeting room unless otherwise stated.
